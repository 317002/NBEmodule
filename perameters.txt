numSections:
    Defines the number of sections that will be used in estimating the
    the noise floor values for the sferic signal

startingRegionFraction:
    The fraction that will define the size of the starting
    region of the sferic signal. The size of the region is defined as a
    percentage of the total temporal length of the signal

noiseThreshold:
    Defines the max allowed noise amplitude compared to the average level of the signal in
		begining time interval defined by startingRegionFraction
		---Has unints of volts/meter----

safetyFactor:
    Scaling factor the deviates the detection thresholds, from the estimated
    noise floor values

minEventWidth(microseconds):
    The minimum allowed temporal width of an event(NBE). This parameter is
    used to filter out random noise spikes which tend to be very short in
    duration compared to true events

nbeRange(microseconds):
    the temporal range, centered around the detection time, that the NBE will be
    defined as occupying

        Format: (a,b)
          typical values:(-30,100) In units of microseconds

max_ecls(takes values in the range [0,5]):
    Max allowed ecls value for source location points

    The lower this value the more confident the algorithm is that the
    determined source location is in fact correct. Defines the size of the region
    the true value could be in.

maxDeviation:float
    A avg deviation from the best fit line is calculated for the time vs elevation
    angle of the radio source location data, within a certain interval associated
    with the identified NBE from the sferic.

    This value is the max allowed avg deviation for the determined NBE to be
    considered.

numProcessingAttempts:
    The max number of attempts the script will make to
    predict radio sources from the channel files. This is needed because sometimes
    the script used, outright fails to find sources when on other attempts there
    is not issue. I think this is a issues caused by the multi threading.

maxFileSize(mega-bytes):
    The max allowed file size the channel files from the intf array can have.
    This limit is imposed because the large ram requirments needed to process
    larges files.

sourceProcLocation:
    The folder location where the source processing script written by mark is
    present

T,S,I,P,W,Y:
    used in the generation of the source data points from the channel data
    off of the INTF array. Defined in more detail in the sources processing dir

    There is an issue with multi threading. To get past this: The T parameter
    should be set to 1, limiting the script to one thread. The issue is
    the inconsistent generation of source location data, some time more or less
    source locations are determined when multi-threading is used.

!!!!Note the spacing under the hash marks here is critical for the script!!!!
